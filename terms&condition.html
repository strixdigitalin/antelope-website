									Customer, as payment is deemed made by your

									cardholder or issuing entity which results
									in cancellation of a transaction in respect
									of which the cardholder or issuing entity
									has been paid or is due to be paid. A
									Chargeback results in an unconditional
									obligation for you to return remitted funds
									and any applicable fees. For more
